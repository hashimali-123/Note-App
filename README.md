# Note-Taking App

A simple, beautiful, and responsive note-taking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Add, view, and delete notes seamlessly. Notes are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the app.

Delete Notes: Remove any note by clicking the "Delete" button.

Click the "Add Note" button or press Enter to save the note.

To delete a note, click the "Delete" button next to the note.
